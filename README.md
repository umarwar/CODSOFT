# # Task 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
This model predicts whether a
passenger on the Titanic survived or not. we will build, train and test a machine learning model to predict titanic survivors based on their features such as age, number of siblings, and ticket class... 
# # Task 2: MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
Movie Rating Prediction," involves building a machine learning model to predict the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately estimates the ratings of movies based on historical data. It involves data preparation, model training, evaluation, and potentially deployment for practical use in movie rating prediction scenarios.
